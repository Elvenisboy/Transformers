    "### Fine-tuning GPT2-medium on a single GPU\n",
    " \n",
    "Large Transformer models are usually trained in multi-GPU(or TPU) setting because training on reasonable batch size and sequence length requires a lots of [tensor|graphical] processing unit memory. My machine is equipped with a single GeForce 1080 Ti which has 11 GB of memory. By empirical tests on GPT2 medium model I found that the maximum total sequence element count over all batches for my GPU to backprop trough is approximetly 550, which is not a lot and might not be sufficient for successful fine-tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there are some things we can take into account and improve the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "First thing to notice is that batch size in forward/ backward pass of Transformer does not play a role because [Layer Normalization](https://mlexplained.com/2018/11/30/an-overview-of-normalization-methods-in-deep-learning/) is used instead of Batch Normalization. In Layer Normalization each feature is normalized across the features dimension instead across the batch dimension as in the Batch Normalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can collect gradients over multiple forward-backward passes and only then do the optimization step. This way we can store in the memory of the GPU a computational graph of one sequence at a time instead of storing coputational graph of all of the batch. With this strategy we can get the same result as if the batch would have been processed in a single forward/backward pass, only with *BATCH_SIZE* times less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together - I will process one sequence at a time with maximum length of 550. The length of joke sequences vary a lot in the dataset I use and to make the the total sequence element count in one optimization step more consistent I will try to fit in as many jokes as possible in the 550 element sequence.
