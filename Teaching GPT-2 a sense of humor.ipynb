The morning of his first day on the job, his wife gives him a kiss goodbye and says, \"Now I want to hear all about it when you come home, dear.\"\\n\\nSo he sets off and drives along Sesame Street.  He makes his first stop, and to his astonishment, on comes a super muscular, extremely-chiseled 6-year-old girl!  The girl says, \"My name\\'s Patricia...and I\\'m LEAN!!\" and takes her seat.  At the next stop, here is a little girl who is even more muscular than the first one...veins popping out, bulging biceps, the whole nine yards.  She steps on to the bus and says to the driver, \"My name is Patricia...and I\\'m MEAN!!!\"  A little baffled by the look of his first two passengers, he continues on with his route.\\n\\nHe reaches the next stop, and feels relieved to see a normal-looking little boy, dressed in a sweater and tie.  He gets on the bus and says to the bus driver, \"My name is Ross...and I\\'m special!\"  The bus driver says, \"That\\'s nice, Ross,\" and Ross takes a seat.\\n\\nAt the next stop there is a little kid in a suit carrying a briefcase.  He introduces himself as \"Lester,\" gets on the bus and sits next to the two muscular girls.  The bus driver continues driving, but can\\'t help but notice through his large rear-view mirror that Lester starts playing Three-card Monte with them, and is cheating!  He thinks to himself, \"He\\'s dead meat if they catch him cheating, but it\\'s not my business to say anything,\" and continues driving.  He starts to notice the faint smell of onions, but doesn\\'t know where it\\'s coming from.  As he gets closer and closer to school, the stench of onions is so strong that the bus driver is almost teary-eyed.\\n\\nFinally all the kids go off to school, and the bus driver, now on lunch break, goes back home to his wife.  \"How was your first day?\" she asked.  He replied, \"You wouldn\\'t believe it: two all-beef patties, special Ross, Lester cheats, reeks of onions on a Sesame Street bus!\"<|endoftext|>']\n",

The alarm went out to all the fire departments for miles around.\\nWhen the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical company president rushed to the fire chief and said, \"All our secret formulas are in the vault in the centre of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact.\"\\n\\nBut the roaring flames held the fire fighters off.\\n\\nSoon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department that could bring out the company\\'s secret files.\\n\\nFrom the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone\\'s amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the large newer fire trucks that were parked around the plant.\\n\\nWithout even slowing down, the old truck drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other fire\\nfighters watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a performance and effort never seen before.\\n\\nWithin a short time, the Norske old timers had the fire well under control and had saved the secret formulas. The grateful chemical company president announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters.\\n\\nThe local TV news reporter rushed in to capture the event on film, asking their chief, \"What are you going to do with all that money?\"\\n\\n\"Vell,\" said Ole Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, \"Da first thing ve gonna do is fix da brakes on dat focking truck!\"<|endoftext|>']\n",
