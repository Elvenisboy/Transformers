# Transformers

Here are two notebooks of transformer implemenatation notebooks:

#### Transformer encoder for Language Modeling implementation in PyTorch [notebook](https://github.com/mf1024/Transformers/blob/master/Transformer%20Encoder%20for%20Language%20Modeling.ipynb)

#### Transformer for Language Translation in PyTorch [notebook](https://github.com/mf1024/Transformers/blob/master/Transformer.ipynb)

I also wrote a blog post about fine-tuning pretrained GPT2 model [here](https://mf1024.github.io/2019/11/12/Fun-With-GPT-2_/)
